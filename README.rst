Django Debug Toolbar
=====================================


The Django Debug Toolbar is a configurable set of panels that display various
debug information about the current request/response and when clicked, display
more details about the panel's content.

Here's a screenshot of the toolbar in action:

In addition to the built-in panels, a number of third-party panels are
contributed by the community.

The current stable version of the Debug Toolbar is 4.1.0. It works on
Django â‰¥ 3.2.4.
